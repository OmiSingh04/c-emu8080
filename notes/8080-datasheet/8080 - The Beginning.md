The intel 8080 is an 8-bit CPU launched in 1974. 

The following notes are me trying to understand every little detail of this wonderful invention. I dont know how long it will take, i dont know if i even will be able to finish it, but i wont know unless I try. And i feel extra passionate about this particular topic... so Why Not! Fuck it, lets give it a go.

I think the outcomes of the project are - 

- A better grasp on C language
- Assembly Language.
- I get to know how a CPU works, which is an epic thing to know.
