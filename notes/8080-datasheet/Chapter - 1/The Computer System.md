A typical computer system consists of - 
- A CPU
- Memory
- Input and Output Devices.

Memory stores data, and instructions.
The program must be organized such that the CPU does not read a non-instruction when it expects an instruction.

Remember, 
```
The CPU is perfect, the program is not.
```

```
A program is a set of logically related instructions.
```

The computer is provided with Input Ports. The CPU can address these input ports. The addition of input ports enables the computer to receive information from external equipment.

Similarly, to communicate the result of the processing, the computer as output ports.


```
The CPU must be able to fetch instructions from meemory, decode their binary and execute them.
```

```
The CPU must be able to reference the memort and IO ports as necessary.
```

```
The CPU must be able to recognize and respond to certain external control signals, such as INTERRUPT and WAIT.
```
